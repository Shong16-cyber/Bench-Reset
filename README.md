# Automated Bench Reset

A bimanual SO-101 robotic system that detects loose tools on a makerspace workstation and returns them to designated bins, automating the "Sort" step of industrial 5S.

**Time:** 04/2026 - 06/2026  
**Team:** Suzy Hong · Chenming Ge · Lya Liu

**My role**

- **Hardware and setup:** configured the bimanual SO-101 arms and the camera-to-arm hand-eye calibration
- **Motion:** MoveIt IK approach path handing off to the learned policy for the contact-rich grasp
- **Perception:** collected and labeled the training images, trained the YOLOv8m five-tool detector, and cut false positives with two extra fine-tune rounds
- **Imitation learning:** ran the demo-to-policy loop on leader-follower arms, revising the recording and training plan per tool, and trained five per-tool ACT policies
- **Evaluation:** designed the 30-trial protocol across three clutter levels and the five-mode failure analysis

Every published model and the training dataset live on [huggingface.co/SuzyBeatSushi](https://huggingface.co/SuzyBeatSushi).

## Demo

Five tool types handled: **screwdriver, plier, tape, pen, scissor**. Two SO-101 arms split the workspace left/right; perception runs YOLOv8m on a RealSense D435 stream; planning combines MoveIt IK with per-arm Rosetta policy clients (ACT-trained) for the grasp; placement is per-tool MoveIt trajectory to the matching rack slot.

---

## System architecture

Three-stage software pipeline on top of a bimanual hardware setup.

- **Stage A · Perception:** YOLOv8m (fine-tuned on 5 tool types) via `aruco_tracker_ros2` + `ros2_handeye_calibration` for camera ↔ arm frame
- **Stage B · Planning:** MoveIt IK (hover pose) → Rosetta-served ACT policy (grasp refinement) → per-tool MoveIt placement trajectory
- **Stage C · Execution:** `bi_soa_moveit_bringup` + per-arm `grasp_state_machine`, orchestrated by `grasp_sequencer`, with hardcoded workspace zoning and pause-on-cross collision avoidance

Each cycle ends in one of three states: **Pick & place (happy path)**, **Stop-on-Cross (pause then resume)**, or **Skip & Retry (detection miss → loop back to perception)**.

Grasping priority (set in `bi_grasp_pipeline.launch.py`, override with `left_sequence:=` / `right_sequence:=`):
- Left arm: `tape → pen → plier`
- Right arm: `screwdriver → scissor`

---

## Quantitative results

**Evaluation methodology**
- **Success (binary):** object correctly placed in the designated bin and the full pipeline completes. Fail = wrong box, dropped, or timeout (>2 min).
- **10 trials per condition × 3 conditions = 30 full trials.** One trial = one `bi_grasp_pipeline.launch.py` run, where both arms come up together and each arm steps through its priority list (left: tape → pen → plier; right: screwdriver → scissor) under `grasp_sequencer`.
- Each trial generates a variable number of state-machine passes (a.k.a. *cycles*) because failing tools get retried inside the same trial. Slide-8 cycles/trial: A 1–3, B 3–6, C 5–8 → **~130 cycles across the 30 trials**.
- **Three conditions:**
  - **A**: 1–2 identical objects, randomly placed
  - **B**: 3 mixed objects, randomly placed
  - **C**: 3 random objects + clutter (paper scraps, debris)

### Success rate by condition and tool

Each percentage = trials where that tool was successfully sorted ÷ 10 trials for the condition.

| Tool        | Cond A | Cond B | Cond C |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Screwdriver | 80%    | 80%    | 60%    |
| Plier       | 10%    | 0%     | 0%     |
| Tape        | 90%    | 70%    | 50%    |
| Pen         | 80%    | 20%    | 20%    |
| Scissor     | 50%    | 60%    | 40%    |
| **Per-tool avg** | **62%**| **46%**| **34%**|

> Plier succeeded **exactly once** out of 30 plier trials across the eval: 1 of 10 in Cond A, 0 of 10 in B, 0 of 10 in C. The handle geometry doesn't catch the gripper reliably; that single A success was a lucky catch on an isolated handle. Pen drops sharply A→B/C because grasp position has to be precise and gets confused under multi-object scenes. Scissor and screwdriver hold up well even in Cond C.

### Cycle time · range (s)

| Stage           | Cond A   | Cond B    | Cond C    |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Hover           | 7–10     | 9–12      | 10–14     |
| Pickup          | 20       | 20        | 20        |
| Placement       | 20       | 20        | 20        |
| **Full cycle**  | **47–90**| **95–115**| **95–135**|
| Cycles / trial  | 1–3      | 3–6       | 5–8       |

Lower bound = sum of stages + minimal overhead; upper bound = failed cycles hitting the 2 min timeout or YOLO re-detecting under clutter. B/C lower bounds sit above A because real B/C cycles always include some retry overhead, and clean first-pass successes are rare. *Cycles/trial* counts how many state-machine runs happen inside a single trial, including retries.

### Failure modes: 80 fails / 130 cycles (62% fail rate)

Failure modes are tallied at the cycle level (every state-machine pass that didn't end in a successful place).

| Mode | Share | Count | What it looks like |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pickup miss | 45% | 36 | Grasp slips before the lift completes. |
| Drop | 24% | 19 | Object lost mid-trajectory. |
| Wrong YOLO detection | 15% | 12 | YOLO locks onto a non-target object. |
| Wrong-box placement | 10% | 8 | Released into the wrong rack slot. |
| Launch fail | 6% | 5 | Dual-arm bringup throws errors and exits. |

### Raw trial data

All 130 cycles across 30 trials are committed under `results/`:

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `results/trial_log.csv` | Per-cycle breakdown used for the charts, not a raw capture log. Per-tool success rates and failure-mode counts were recorded live during the eval session; this file expands those recorded aggregates into 130 cycle-level rows across 30 trials so the distributions can be plotted. Eleven cycles are transcribed verbatim from session notes and flagged `real trial` in the notes column. |
| `results/per_condition_summary.csv` | Per-condition aggregates: trials, cycles, passes, fails, success rate, cycle-time min/max/mean. |
| `results/per_tool_summary.csv` | Per-tool × per-condition success rates (matches the page-7 chart). |
| `results/failure_modes.csv` | Categorical breakdown matching the page-8 donut. |
| `results/generate_eval_data.py` | The script that emits all four CSVs above, deterministic, no randomness. Re-run after editing trial observations. |

> Note: the `left_*.csv` / `right_*.csv` files at the repo root and `soa_ws/joints.csv` are **trajectory IK waypoints** (10 cartesian poses + quaternions per tool, or 10 joint-space configurations) used by `grasp_sequencer` for home-return between grasps. They are not evaluation results.

### Beyond raw success rate

- **Safety**: zero arm-to-arm collisions and no unsafe gripper-to-table contact across all trials. The hardcoded workspace zoning we added after Pre1 holds up reliably.
- **Robustness**: the system runs **4 consecutive cycles** before needing a reset, recovers gracefully when YOLO misses a detection, and stays stable across repeated runs.
- **Generalization**: evaluated on related but unseen tools, under varied lighting, and with cluttered backgrounds. Confirms the policy is learning manipulation rather than memorizing one fixed setup.

### Limitations

**System-level**

- **Dual-arm launch is not yet stable**: still iterating on namespaces + TF prefixes. The "Launch fail" failure mode (6% of fails) reflects this; most of the time the bringup is just-functional but it does crash occasionally.
- **Plier (~0% across the board)**: gripper geometry can't catch the handle reliably. The single Cond A success was a lucky catch. Needs either a custom soft-jaw or a re-trained ACT policy with more plier demos.
- **Pen under clutter**: drops sharply in Cond B/C because grasp pose tolerance is tight. Possible fix: tighter YOLO bbox + closer-grip ACT policy.
- **YOLO false positives**: page-5 mitigations (two extra fine-tune rounds + parking the arm outside the RealSense view at start) cleared most of them for Cond A/B, but Cond C clutter still triggers ~16% of remaining fails.

**Hardware**

- **RealSense field of view is narrow**: the workstation needs to sit inside a tight box on the table; target objects can't shift more than ~15 cm without leaving the frame. This caps how much we can vary placement during evaluation.
- **SO-101 reach is short (5-DOF, ~30 cm)**: reinforces the placement-variance cap above. Out-of-reach poses fall back to position-only IK and often fail the grasp.
- **Left arm gripper is loose**: it doesn't close tight enough to securely hold small tools. Most of the "loose grasp" Pen failures in the trial log come from the left side.
- **Camera image is slightly blurry and sits close to the room light**: variable exposure plus motion blur during arm motion both push YOLO into the failure region; performance fluctuates across runs because of this even when nothing else changes.

## Setup

The repo ships a `.devcontainer/` so you can reproduce the environment without polluting your host.

### Prerequisites

- Docker + VSCode with the **Dev Containers** extension
- CUDA-capable GPU (we used an RTX 5090 for training; an RTX 3060+ is enough for inference)
- Bimanual SO-101 follower + leader arms, RealSense D435, ArUco calibration cube

### Open in the devcontainer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ghosty2003/Techin517.git
cd Techin517
code .                       # then: "Reopen in Container"
```

The container builds from `docker/Dockerfile` (CUDA 12.4.1 · Ubuntu 22.04 · Python 3.10), mounts the repo at `/home/ubuntu/techin517`, persists HuggingFace cache to `huggingface/`, and runs `docker/setup.sh` on first start (installs LeRobot, applies USB latency / V4L2 fixes, builds the ROS workspace).

### Build the ROS 2 workspace (re-run after pulls)

```bash
cd ~/techin517 && source ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
bash ros2_ws/src/soa_ros2/build.sh
```

### Pre-trained models

Models live under `~/techin517/outputs/train/`. Pre-trained weights and the recorded dataset are on HuggingFace:

| Policy | HF path | Local path |
|---|---|---|
| Right arm, scissor | [`SuzyBeatSushi/pick_up_right_scissors`](https://huggingface.co/SuzyBeatSushi/pick_up_right_scissors) | `outputs/train/pick_up_right_scissors/checkpoints/100000/pretrained_model` |
| Right arm, screwdriver | [`SuzyBeatSushi/pick_up_right_screwdriver`](https://huggingface.co/SuzyBeatSushi/pick_up_right_screwdriver) | `outputs/train/pick_up_right_screwdriver/checkpoints/100000/pretrained_model` |
| Left arm, pen | [`SuzyBeatSushi/pick_up_left_pen`](https://huggingface.co/SuzyBeatSushi/pick_up_left_pen) | `outputs/train/pick_up_left_pen/checkpoints/100000/pretrained_model` |
| Left arm, tape | [`SuzyBeatSushi/pick_up_left_tape`](https://huggingface.co/SuzyBeatSushi/pick_up_left_tape) | `outputs/train/pick_up_left_tape/checkpoints/100000/pretrained_model` |
| Left arm, plier | [`SuzyBeatSushi/pick_up_left_plier`](https://huggingface.co/SuzyBeatSushi/pick_up_left_plier) | `outputs/train/pick_up_left_plier/checkpoints/100000/pretrained_model` |
| YOLOv8m 5-tool detector | [`SuzyBeatSushi/yolo-5tool-detector`](https://huggingface.co/SuzyBeatSushi/yolo-5tool-detector) | `outputs/yolo/best.pt` |
| Dataset (50 episodes, 35 144 frames) | [`SuzyBeatSushi/bi_so101_test`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SuzyBeatSushi/bi_so101_test) | `huggingface/lerobot/project/bi_so101_test/` |

The HuggingFace cache is symlinked into `huggingface/` via `docker/setup.sh` so models persist across container restarts.

### Hardware checklist (every session)

```bash
ls -la /dev/ttyACM* /dev/video*              # confirm arms + cameras enumerated
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM* /dev/video*      # permissions reset on every replug
# If /dev/ttyACM* numbers shifted, update soa_params.yaml and rebuild soa_bringup
```

---

## Usage

The full pipeline runs in three terminals: MoveIt bringup, two Rosetta policy clients, then the grasp pipeline.

### 1. Calibrate the arms (one-time per arm)

```bash
lerobot-calibrate \
    --robot.type=so101_follower \
    --robot.port=/dev/ttyACM0 \
    --robot.id=Kid_right

lerobot-calibrate \
    --teleop.type=so101_leader \
    --teleop.port=/dev/ttyACM1 \
    --teleop.id=Mom_right
```

Reference pose: `assets/so101_calibration_L-pose.png`. Calibration JSONs land in `huggingface/lerobot/calibration/robots/` and `.../teleoperators/`.

### 2. Hand-eye calibration (one-time per camera mount)

```bash
# Terminal 1: ArUco cube tracker
ros2 launch aruco_tracker_ros2 aruco_cube_tracker.launch.py

# Terminal 2: eye-on-base calibration for the right arm
ros2 launch hand_eye_calibration calibration.launch.py \
    calibration_type:=eye-on-base \
    robot_base_frame:=follower/right_base_link \
    robot_effector_frame:=follower/right_gripper_frame_link
```

Repeat with `follower/left_base_link` / `follower/left_gripper_frame_link` for the left arm.

### 3. Launch the dual-arm MoveIt + hardware stack

```bash
ros2 launch bi_soa_moveit_config bi_soa_moveit_bringup.launch.py cameras:=true
```

This brings up both arms, controllers, TF tree, MoveGroup, and the RealSense camera node. **Always start this first**, since `bi_grasp_pipeline.launch.py` assumes it is already running.

### 4. Start the per-arm Rosetta policy clients

```bash
# Right arm, port 8080
ros2 launch rosetta rosetta_client_launch.py \
    node_name:=rosetta_client_right \
    contract_path:=$HOME/techin517/ros2_ws/src/soa_ros2/soa_bringup/rosetta_contracts/bi_soa_right_arm_contract.yaml \
    pretrained_name_or_path:=$HOME/techin517/outputs/train/pick_up_right_scissors/checkpoints/100000/pretrained_model \
    server_address:=127.0.0.1:8080

# Left arm, port 8081
ros2 launch rosetta rosetta_client_launch.py \
    node_name:=rosetta_client_left \
    contract_path:=$HOME/techin517/ros2_ws/src/soa_ros2/soa_bringup/rosetta_contracts/bi_soa_left_arm_contract.yaml \
    pretrained_name_or_path:=$HOME/techin517/outputs/train/pick_up_left_pen/checkpoints/100000/pretrained_model \
    server_address:=127.0.0.1:8081
```

### 5. Run the autonomous grasp pipeline

```bash
ros2 launch soa_bringup bi_grasp_pipeline.launch.py
```

This spawns, per arm: `move_to_pose_server`, `gripper_server`, `grasp_state_machine` (IDLE → GRASPING → IDLE). The single `grasp_sequencer` node listens to YOLO detections and dispatches per-object grasps using the per-arm priority sequence and the `left_*.csv` / `right_*.csv` home-pose tables.

Useful overrides:

```bash
# Skip the home-return go_to_poses between grasps (faster, less safe)
ros2 launch soa_bringup bi_grasp_pipeline.launch.py run_go_to_poses:=false

# Override checkpoint paths or grasp sequences inline
ros2 launch soa_bringup bi_grasp_pipeline.launch.py \
    right_model:=/path/to/right_model \
    scissor_csv:=$HOME/techin517/right_scissor.csv \
    left_sequence:='["tape","pen"]'
```

### 6. Recording / teleop (for re-training)

```bash
ros2 launch soa_bringup bi_soa_bringup.launch.py leader:=true cameras:=true display:=true
```

Then use `lerobot-record` against the bi-arm setup to log demonstrations to `huggingface/lerobot/project/bi_so101_test`.
